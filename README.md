## Synopsis

This test framework enables the creation of API and UI acceptance tests of the hotel booking form.

The appropriate chromedriver for the system will automatically be downloaded to and then run from the default maven repository (found at ~/.m2).

## Tests

There are a few positive and negative test cases in the test suite, for the API and UI.

You will need Google Chrome and Maven installed in order to run the tests. They can then be run from the root of the project using the command _mvn test_.
